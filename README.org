* Minecraft server config

  This is the configuration for a private server I play with a few friends. I
  like backups and Git, and this might be useful to some people.
* What it's running
  I'm using hMod build 128 (for now), a couple plugins, and the excellent
  =daemonize.php= script for restarting the server when it dies (which happens a
  lot, since I'm on a server with "only" 700MB of RAM).

  Feel free to grab code, settings, or inspiration from this config, or not ;).
